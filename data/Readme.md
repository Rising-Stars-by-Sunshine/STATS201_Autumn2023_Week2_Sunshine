# Title: Applying Machine Learning Algorithms for Detecting Misinformation Online
This GitHub repository is dedicated to a machine learning project aimed at detecting online misinformation. The model leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with Multi-Label Classification and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). The primary data source for this project is social networks' APIs. We collect and utilize data from these platforms to train our model, classifying online information into various categories, such as biased/objective, clickbait/not-clickbait, fake/true, rumor/fact, satire/not-satire, and outdated/up-to-date. The algorithm is designed for binary classification within each category. 

# Description
The developed misinformation detection model expects to achieve the following results: 
• Determining the algorithms better suited for the machine learning algorithm; 
• Analyzing the preliminary data interpretation and detecting refinery areas; 
• Providing an accurate detection of the classification of the information; 
• Evaluation of the common trends shared between the data.
